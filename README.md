# burger-eater-app
A burger logger app that keeps track of burgers and wether or not it's been eaten. The app is built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

## Problem & Solution

The goal here is to create a fullstack application that allows a user to enter a burger, saves it to the database, and allows the user to devour the burger.
